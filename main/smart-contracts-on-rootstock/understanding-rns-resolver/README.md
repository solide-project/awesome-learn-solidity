# Understanding RNS Resolver

## Recap of RNS

If you haven't read the [Understanding RNS Registry](https://dapp.solide0x.tech/learn/smart-contracts-on-rootstock/understanding-rns-registry) guide, we recommend doing so before proceeding with this guide. However, TDLR RIF Naming Service (RNS) is a decentralized naming service that simplifies the process of managing names and addresses on the Rootstock blockchain. It consists of two main components: the RNS Registry and the Resolver. The Registry organizes domain names in a hierarchical tree structure, while the Resolver responds to queries by providing the necessary information linked to a domain name which this guide will focus on.
